# Mentor Project: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) in Java

## Project Overview

This project is designed to provide a hands-on learning experience with ORM in Java. It showcases how to bridge the gap between object-oriented programming and relational databases, simplifying data persistence and management.

## Key Technologies

- **Java** (programming language)
- **Maven** (build tool)
- **VS Code** (development environment)
- **Devcontainers** (consistent development environment)
- **ORM framework** ( Hibernate )

**## Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine.
   - Install the VS Code Remote Development extension pack.

2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DeepeshKalura/orm_full_stack_mentor_project
   ```

3. **Open in Devcontainer:**
   - Open the project folder in VS Code.
   - Click on the "Open in Container" button in the bottom-left corner.
   - This will build and launch the devcontainer, providing a consistent development environment.

## Building and Running the Project

1. **Building:**   
     ```bash
     mvn clean install
